# **Help**

If you encounter problems, we recommend the following strategies:

+ Take a step back, and make sure to thoroughly go over the [tutorial](../tutorial/tutorial.html).

+ If that doesn't work, [submit an issue](https://github.com/Campbell-Muscle-Lab/project_absorbance_analysis/issues).

+ If you don't hear back in 3 days, 
    - email [Utku Gulbulak](mailto:utku.gulbulak@uky.edu) for interface related questions.
    - email [Melissa E. Jauquet](mailto:mja361@uky.edu) and [Jeremy P. Wood](mailto:Jeremy.Wood@uky.edu) for assay related questions.
